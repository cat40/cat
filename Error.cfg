"Sorry about that Chief."
Somehow, we missed something.
I don't know what happened. Do you?
Don't worry. We will all go together when we go.
"Have I ever failed you? Have I failed you recently? How about today?"
Bye now.
I'm a Ralphie program!
ERROR: NO ERROR MESSAGE FOUND
A nice lovley error all for me! You're so nice.
An error! Of course it's an error! User, it is my unqualified opinion that this is an error! Just one question. What is the error?
I'm feeling rather misanthropic today. Maybe I'll take over the world. 
Doh!
When you're feeling lonely, when you're feeling sad, I'll give you an error so that things won't be so bad!
Computer! This is a program! We do not error here!
That does not compute
Sucess! An error!
YOU DIDN'T SAY THE MAGIC WORD!
